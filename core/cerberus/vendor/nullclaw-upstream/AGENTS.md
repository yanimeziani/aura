# AGENTS.md — nullclaw Agent Engineering Protocol

This file defines the default working protocol for coding agents in this repository.
Scope: entire repository.

## 1) Project Snapshot (Read First)

nullclaw is a Zig-first autonomous AI assistant runtime optimized for:

- minimal binary size (target: < 1 MB ReleaseSmall)
- minimal memory footprint (target: < 5 MB peak RSS)
- zero dependencies beyond libc and optional SQLite
- full feature parity with ZeroClaw (Rust reference implementation)

Core architecture is **vtable-driven** and modular. All extension work is done by implementing
vtable structs and registering them in factory functions.

Key extension points:

- `src/providers/root.zig` (`Provider`) — AI model providers
- `src/channels/root.zig` (`Channel`) — messaging channels
- `src/tools/root.zig` (`Tool`) — tool execution surface
- `src/memory/root.zig` (`Memory`) — memory backends
- `src/observability.zig` (`Observer`) — observability hooks
- `src/runtime.zig` (`RuntimeAdapter`) — execution environments
- `src/peripherals.zig` (`Peripheral`) — hardware boards (Arduino, STM32, RPi)

Current scale: **151 source files, ~96K lines of code, 3,371 tests**.

Build and test:

```bash
zig build                           # dev build
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall  # release build
zig build test --summary all        # run all tests
```

## 2) Deep Architecture Observations (Why This Protocol Exists)

These codebase realities should drive every design decision:

1. **Vtable + factory architecture is the stability backbone**
   - Extension points are explicit and swappable via `ptr: *anyopaque` + `vtable: *const VTable`.
   - Callers must OWN the implementing struct (local var or heap-alloc). Never return a vtable interface pointing to a temporary — the pointer will dangle.
   - Most features should be added via vtable implementation + factory registration, not cross-cutting rewrites.

2. **Binary size and memory are hard product constraints**
   - `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` is the release target. Every dependency and abstraction has a size cost.
   - Avoid adding libc calls, runtime allocations, or large data tables without justification.
   - `MaxRSS` during `zig build test` must stay well under 50 MB.

3. **Security-critical surfaces are first-class**
   - `src/gateway.zig`, `src/security/`, `src/tools/`, `src/runtime.zig` carry high blast radius.
   - Defaults are secure-by-default (pairing, HTTPS-only, allowlists, AEAD encryption). Keep it that way.

4. **Zig 0.15.2 API is the baseline — no newer features**
   - HTTP client: `std.http.Client.fetch()` with `std.Io.Writer.Allocating` for response body capture.
   - Child processes: `std.process.Child.init(argv, allocator)`, `.Pipe` (capitalized).
   - stdout: `std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&buf)` → use `.interface` for `print`/`flush`.
   - `std.io.getStdOut()` does NOT exist in 0.15 — use `std.fs.File.stdout()`.
   - SQLite: linked via `/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlite/{lib,include}` on the compile step, not the module.
   - `ArrayListUnmanaged`: init with `.empty`, pass allocator to every method.

5. **All 3,371+ tests must pass at zero leaks**
   - The test suite uses `std.testing.allocator` (leak-detecting GPA). Every allocation must be freed.
   - `Config.load()` allocates — always wrap in `std.heap.ArenaAllocator` in tests and production.
   - `ChaCha20Poly1305.decrypt` segfaults on tag failure with heap-allocated output on macOS/Zig 0.15 — use a stack buffer then `allocator.dupe()`.

## 3) Engineering Principles (Normative)

These principles are mandatory. They are implementation constraints, not suggestions.

### 3.1 KISS

Required:
- Prefer straightforward control flow over meta-programming.
- Prefer explicit comptime branches and typed structs over hidden dynamic behavior.
- Keep error paths obvious and localized.

### 3.2 YAGNI

Required:
- Do not add config keys, vtable methods, or feature flags without a concrete caller.
- Do not introduce speculative abstractions.
- Keep unsupported paths explicit (`return error.NotSupported`) rather than silent no-ops.

### 3.3 DRY + Rule of Three

Required:
- Duplicate small local logic when it preserves clarity.
- Extract shared helpers only after repeated, stable patterns (rule-of-three).
- When extracting, preserve module boundaries and avoid hidden coupling.

### 3.4 Fail Fast + Explicit Errors

Required:
- Prefer explicit errors for unsupported or unsafe states.
- Never silently broaden permissions or capabilities.
- In tests: `builtin.is_test` guards are acceptable to skip side effects (e.g., spawning browsers), but the guard must be explicit and documented.

### 3.5 Secure by Default + Least Privilege

Required:
- Deny-by-default for access and exposure boundaries.
- Never log secrets, raw tokens, or sensitive payloads.
- All outbound URLs must be HTTPS. HTTP is rejected at the tool layer.
- Keep network/filesystem/shell scope as narrow as possible.

### 3.6 Determinism + No Flaky Tests

Required:
- Tests must not spawn real network connections, open browsers, or depend on system state.
- Use `builtin.is_test` to bypass side effects (spawning, opening URLs, real hardware I/O).
- Tests must be reproducible across macOS and Linux.

## 4) Repository Map (High-Level)

```

## 5) Risk Tiers by Path (Review Depth Contract)

- **Low risk**: docs, comments, test additions, minor formatting
- **Medium risk**: most `src/**` behavior changes without boundary/security impact
- **High risk**: `src/security/**`, `src/gateway.zig`, `src/tools/**`, `src/runtime.zig`, config schema, vtable interfaces

When uncertain, classify as higher risk.

## 6) Agent Workflow (Required)

1. **Read before write** — inspect existing module, vtable wiring, and adjacent tests before editing.
2. **Define scope boundary** — one concern per change; avoid mixed feature+refactor+infra patches.
3. **Implement minimal patch** — apply KISS/YAGNI/DRY rule-of-three explicitly.
4. **Validate** — `zig build test --summary all` must show 0 failures and 0 leaks.
5. **Document impact** — update comments/docs for behavior changes, risk, and side effects.

### 6.1 Code Naming Contract (Required)

Apply these naming rules consistently:

- All identifiers: `snake_case` for functions, variables, fields, modules, files.
- Types, structs, enums, unions: `PascalCase` (e.g., `AnthropicProvider`, `BrowserTool`).
- Constants and comptime values: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` or `PascalCase` depending on context.
- Vtable implementer naming: `<Name>Provider`, `<Name>Channel`, `<Name>Tool`, `<Name>Memory`, `<Name>Sandbox`.
- Factory registration keys: stable, lowercase, user-facing (e.g., `"openai"`, `"telegram"`, `"shell"`).
- Tests: named by behavior (`subject_expected_behavior`), fixtures use neutral names.

### 6.2 Architecture Boundary Contract (Required)

- Extend capabilities by adding vtable implementations + factory wiring first.
- Keep dependency direction inward to contracts: concrete implementations depend on vtable/config/util, not on each other.
- Avoid cross-subsystem coupling (provider code importing channel internals, tool code mutating gateway policy).
- Keep module responsibilities single-purpose: orchestration in `agent/`, transport in `channels/`, model I/O in `providers/`, policy in `security/`, execution in `tools/`.

## 7) Change Playbooks

### 7.1 Adding a Provider

- Add `src/providers/<name>.zig` implementing `Provider.VTable` (`chatWithSystem`, `chat`, `supportsNativeTools`, `getName`, `deinit`).
- Register in `src/providers/root.zig` factory.
- `chatImpl` must extract system/user from `request.messages` (see existing providers for pattern).
- Add tests for vtable wiring, error paths, and config parsing.

### 7.2 Adding a Channel

- Add `src/channels/<name>.zig` implementing `Channel.VTable`.
- Keep `send`, `listen`, `name`, `isConfigured` semantics consistent with existing channels.
- Cover auth/config/health behavior with tests.

### 7.3 Adding a Tool

- Add `src/tools/<name>.zig` implementing `Tool.VTable` (`execute`, `name`, `description`, `parameters_json`).
- Validate and sanitize all inputs. Return `ToolResult`; never panic in the runtime path.
- Add `builtin.is_test` guard if the tool spawns processes or opens network connections.
- Register in `src/tools/root.zig`.

### 7.4 Adding a Peripheral

- Implement the `Peripheral` interface in `src/peripherals.zig`.
- Peripherals expose `read`/`write` methods that delegate to real hardware I/O.
- Use `probe-rs` CLI for STM32/Nucleo flash access; serial JSON protocol for Arduino.
- Non-Linux platforms must return `error.UnsupportedOperation` (not silent 0).

### 7.5 Security / Runtime / Gateway Changes

- Include threat/risk notes in the commit or PR.
- Add/update tests for failure modes and boundaries.
- Keep observability useful but non-sensitive (no secrets in logs or errors).

## 8) Validation Matrix

Required before any code commit:

```bash
zig build test --summary all        # all tests must pass, 0 leaks
```

For release changes:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall  # must compile clean
```

Additional expectations by change type:

- **Docs/comments only**: no build required, but verify no broken code references.
- **Security/runtime/gateway/tools**: include at least one boundary/failure-mode test.
- **Provider additions**: test vtable wiring + graceful failure without credentials.

If full validation is impractical, document what was run and what was skipped.

### 8.1 Git Hooks

The repository ships with pre-configured hooks in `.githooks/`. Activate once per clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Hooks:

| Hook | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `pre-commit` | Runs `zig fmt --check src/` — blocks commit if any file is not formatted |
| `pre-push` | Runs `zig build test --summary all` — blocks push if any test fails or leaks |

To bypass a hook in an emergency: `git commit --no-verify` / `git push --no-verify`.

## 9) Privacy and Sensitive Data (Required)

- Never commit real API keys, tokens, credentials, personal data, or private URLs.
- Use neutral placeholders in tests: `"test-key"`, `"example.com"`, `"user_a"`.
- Test fixtures must be impersonal and system-focused.
- Review `git diff --cached` before push for accidental sensitive strings.

## 10) Anti-Patterns (Do Not)

- Do not add C dependencies or large Zig packages without strong justification (binary size impact).
- Do not return vtable interfaces pointing to temporaries — dangling pointer.
- Do not use `std.io.getStdOut()` — it does not exist in Zig 0.15.
- Do not silently weaken security policy or access constraints.
- Do not add speculative config/feature flags "just in case".
- Do not skip `defer allocator.free(...)` — every allocation must be freed.
- Do not use `ArrayListUnmanaged.writer()` as `?*Io.Writer` — incompatible types.
- Do not modify unrelated modules "while here".
- Do not include personal identity or sensitive information in tests, examples, docs, or commits.
- Do not use `SQLITE_TRANSIENT` in auto-translated C code — use `SQLITE_STATIC` (null) instead.
- Do not use heap-allocated output buffers in `ChaCha20Poly1305.decrypt` — use stack buffer + `allocator.dupe()`.

## 11) Handoff Template (Agent → Agent / Maintainer)

When handing off work, include:

1. What changed
2. What did not change
3. Validation run and results (`zig build test --summary all`)
4. Remaining risks / unknowns
5. Next recommended action

## 12) Vibe Coding Guardrails

When working in fast iterative mode:

- Keep each iteration reversible (small commits, clear rollback).
- Validate assumptions with code search before implementing.
- Prefer deterministic behavior over clever shortcuts.
- Do not "ship and hope" on security-sensitive paths.
- If uncertain about Zig 0.15 API, check `src/` for existing usage patterns before guessing.
- If uncertain about architecture, read the vtable interface definition before implementing.
